# CLAUDE.md: shifupo-reels

Remotion project for **Shifu Po (Feng Shui & BaZi consultant)** promotional Instagram Reels, in smooth 2D "anime-style" animation, with 3D where an object or camera move is stronger in space. The plan for the first reel, and the quality bar for every later one, is `docs/PLAN-SP01.md`. Read it before starting any phase.

## Output spec

- 1080x1920, 30 fps, 15 to 30 seconds, H.264 + AAC, at most 30 MB.
- Every on-screen text stays inside `SAFE_AREA` in `src/lib/brand.ts` (x 64, y 314, w 792, h 1122).

## Hard rules

1. Frame-driven animation only (`useCurrentFrame`, `interpolate`, `spring`, helpers in `src/lib/motion.ts`). Never `Date.now()`, `setTimeout`, CSS animations or transitions, or `Math.random()`. Randomness: `random(seed)` or `@remotion/noise`.
   - 3D: live with `<ThreeCanvas>` from `@remotion/three` (React Three Fiber), every transform computed from `useCurrentFrame()`. Never R3F `useFrame`, `THREE.Clock`, or controls (`OrbitControls`).
   - anime.js: only frame-driven (`autoplay: false`, then `.seek(frame / fps * 1000)` on every render). Never let it run on its own clock.
2. "Anime smooth" motion rules in `docs/PLAN-SP01.md` part 6: no linear moves, anticipation and overshoot, follow-through, stagger, never a dead-still frame, at least three parallax depths, ink-wipe plus match-move transitions.
3. No hardcoded scene durations. Durations come from the voice over via `calculateMetadata`; events are tied to cue words, never to seconds.
4. No magic numbers: colors, fonts, sizes, safe zones in `src/lib/brand.ts`; timing in `src/lib/timing.ts`; motion curves in `src/lib/motion.ts`.
5. Content lives in `data/episodes/*.json`, validated by `src/schema.ts` (cues spoken exactly once, numbers match the VO). Components never contain episode copy.
6. Secrets only in `.env` (gitignored). Never read, print or log API keys. Keep `.env.example` updated.
7. Licensing: only commercially licensed BGM, recorded in `public/audio/bgm/LICENSES.md`. Sound effects are synthesized by `npm run sfx`.
8. Brand comes from the Shifu Po website (`../shifupo-home-v2`): ink, paper, gold, seal red; Plus Jakarta Sans, Cinzel, Noto Serif SC; "Anda".

## Brand

- Ink `#12100E`, paper `#F8F4EC`, gold `#C9A45C` / `#9C7A35` / `#F1DDA8`, seal red `#A8161D`.
- Motifs: cream paper, sumi-e mountains, gold luo pan, bamboo, red seals, koi, gold coins, blueprints, lattice corners.
- Shifu Po figure: `public/assets/shifu/shifu.png` (spec in that folder). Until it exists, an ink silhouette stands in.

## Commands

- `npm run setup`: first-run check (Node, ffmpeg, `.env` filled or not, SFX, Shifu photo); creates `.env` from `.env.example` if missing
- `npm run studio`: preview in Remotion Studio
- `npm run produce -- sp01 [--draft] [--from <step>]`: whole pipeline (TTS, VO levels, SFX, render, loudness, whisper check) to `out/sp01_final.mp4` plus `out/sp01_report.md` and a frame sheet. Without `.env` it renders without VO on estimated timing. When every check passes, only the final reel is copied to `../Video/` (`FINAL_DIR`, override with env `VIDEO_FINAL_DIR`) as `"SP01 - <title>.mp4"`. Working files never go to `../Video/`.
- `npm run tts -- sp01`, `npm run vo-level -- sp01`, `npm run sfx`, `npm run render -- sp01 [--draft]`, `npm run postprocess -- sp01`
- `npm run stills -- sp01 40 165 385 --scale 1`: full-size frames for checks
- `npm test`, `npm run lint`, `npm run check` (test + lint + typecheck; must pass before a commit)

## Guides

Step-by-step guides (Indonesian) in `docs/guides/`; follow the one for the step you are on:

| Step | Guide |
|---|---|
| Idea | `01-PLANNING-IDE.md` |
| Content, episode JSON | `02-PLANNING-KONTEN.md` |
| Scene by scene, adding a scene type | `03-SCENE-BY-SCENE.md` |
| 2D assets | `04-ASET-2D.md` |
| 3D assets (live `@remotion/three`, or pre-rendered PNG sequences) | `05-ASET-3D.md` |
| Asset folders and frame placement | `06-PENEMPATAN-ASET.md` |
| Animation | `07-ANIMASI.md` |
| QA, clean and precise result | `08-QA-HASIL-BERSIH.md` |
| Website photos, free scene order, realistic animals | `09-ASET-WEBSITE-DAN-SCENE.md` |
| Semi-realistic 3D: CC0 assets, AssetGate, layout + camera quality gates | `10-3D-REALISTIS.md` |

Scene order is free since SP02 (`EPISODE_RULES` in `src/schema.ts`): 4 to 7 scenes, opens with `hook` or `pond`, ends with exactly one `cta`. Website photos: only Shifu Po's own photos and logo; never chat screenshots, third-party logos or clients' faces.

Asset folders: `public/assets/shifu/`, `brand/`, `2d/common/`, `2d/<id>/`, `3d/<name>/`.

## New episodes

Use the `/buat-video` skill (`.claude/skills/buat-video/SKILL.md`): plan with `docs/templates/PLAN-TEMPLATE.md`, get one approval, then produce without stopping. Laptop setup: `docs/setup/SETUP-LAPTOP.md`.

Master prompt: for any content request (a new reel, a plan, or a batch of ideas such as "100 ide konten"), first read `../Prompt/MASTER-PROMPT-SHIFUPO.txt` (`D:\SHIFUPO\Prompt\MASTER-PROMPT-SHIFUPO.txt`) and follow it. It defines three modes: a short prompt gets every gap filled and marked [REKOMENDASI], a full prompt keeps every choice the user made and adds more precision, and a bank-of-ideas mode. It also defines the retention map, the plan format and the closing confirmation. A short prompt still gets a full, detailed plan; a complete prompt must get an even sharper one. The user prefers everything combined in one file.
